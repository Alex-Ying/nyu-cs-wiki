# Club Sports

There are a number of club sports available to join. In order to participate, it is at least necessary to get an NYU Club Sports Examination form (an appointment can be scheduled from the Student Health Center). Depending on the sport, you may need to go through other forms as well. More information can be found on the [main website](https://gonyuathletics.com/sports/campusrecreation). For signing up for sports, you can find that [here](https://nyu.dserec.com/online/clubsports).
