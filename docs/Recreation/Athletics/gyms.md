# Gyms

## NYU

- [Tandon](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/250369759#map=19/40.69454/-73.98679): The workout gym is overall pretty small, with two primary areas for working out. It also gets very crowded after 4:00 PM until around 8:00 PM (when students' classes end) so it's best to go during the middle of the day.

- [Palladium](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2547205434): A large gym. The first floor has a number of cardio exercise machines along with the climbing wall, free for all NYU students to use, though it's available only during certain hours. The second floor focuses more on strength training. 

- [404 Fitness](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2546985543): A large gym though filled with students. There's a small turf area unique to this gym (when compared to the other NYU gyms). It also has machines for cardio/strength.
