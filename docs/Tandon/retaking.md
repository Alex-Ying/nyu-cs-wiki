# Retaking Classes 

You can optionally retake a class one or two times if you are not satisfied with the first grade or if you failed the class. The grade you get when retaking the class will replace the original grade received on your GPA, regardless of whether the received grade is better or worse. Both subjects and their respective grades will be shown on your transcript. The repeated course must be taken within one year of the first course or the first time it is offered. More information can be found [here](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/registration/registration-policies). 

## Should I retake this class?
 
If you aren't doing graduate school, probably not.

If you are, then it may be worth retaking the classes if the classes are in the domain of computer science.
