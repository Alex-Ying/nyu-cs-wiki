# Projects

Projects are a great way to put your programming skills to practical use. As you start your career they will also be an important part of your resume in lieu of actual work experience.

A good project should be something that you are interested in. It should also be something that you can complete in a reasonable amount of time but you could also split up a project into smaller parts. You can think about various annoyances in your life and how software might alleviate them. If you are not sure what to work on, you can look at the list of projects, [Project Based Learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning).
