# Planning and Scheduling

* [CAS](https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/departments-and-programs/department-of-computer-science/program-of-study-cas-bulletin.html)
* [Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-bs)

Both CAS and Tandon have a sample/recommended schedule. You should consult with your academic advisor to determine how your specific circumstances affect your schedule such as transfer credits, AP credits, etc. If you are also experienced in programming you can also skip some of the intro classes either with a placement test or by asking your advisor/professor.

As a recommendation, you should take core (required) classes ASAP as many of them are pre-requisites for electives.
