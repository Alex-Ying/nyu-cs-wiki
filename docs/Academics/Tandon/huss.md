# NYU Tandon Humanities/Social Science (HUSS) Electives

As part of the general education requirements for students at Tandon, you need to take 16 credits worth of HUSS electives. You can find more information on the [Tandon website](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/technology-culture-and-society/general-education-requirements). Currently, one of the elective courses must be an ethics course and one course must be an advanced seminar.

To have a course taken at another university besides NYU count towards a HUSS credit, fill out this form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaRBN_bfmiMGwawD-zAhTzwkuyz6KJ25i6vcylG7gyfUeHuQ/viewform). The criteria for approved HUSS classes is learning material that doesn't teach a "skill" (the main example given is no practical music or acting class). In practice, the classes approved are somewhat arbitrary.
