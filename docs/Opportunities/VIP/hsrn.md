# Description

The Holodeck: High Speed Research Network VIP is a research oriented VIP focused on maintaining, improving, and extending the dedicated fiber optic network connecting NYU's Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan, and Midtown campuses.[^1] Some projects include a custom pub/sub server, a high speed parallel file system, AI-powered network intrusion detection system, and real time AI/VR applications[^2].

It differs from many other VIPs in that it is research oriented instead of competition based, and it is a good choice to learn more about building software in a research environment.

From the HSRN VIP Homepage[^3]:

> The NYU High Speed Research Network (HSRN) VIP is a student-led group of exceptional and cross-disciplinary students focused on creating high-quality deliverables and projects centered around Research Technology Infrastructure, as well as providing resources and impact to the broader NYU student community.
