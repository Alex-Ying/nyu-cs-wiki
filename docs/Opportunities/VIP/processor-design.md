# Description

Processor Design is focused on "taking novel microprocessor designs from ideation, through RTL design, verification, synthesis, layout, and finally tapeout and validation in real silicon". The CPU has a RISC-V-32I[^1] architecture. After a series of onboarding labs which will have students get acquainted with verilog and a proper C++ development environement, students will specialize in a specific area. There are "czars" who lead specific parts of the tech stack, including the CPU, memory, AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture), simulator, and onboarding/documentation.

Throughout the semester, students will update their design notebook where they journal their progress. The amount of work required for the VIP is based on the number of credits it is taken for.
