# Interships

## Why

Internships are a great way to get experience in the field. They are also a great way to get a job after graduation. Many companies will offer return offers to interns.

## When

One of the biggest mistakes is when to apply for internships. Applications open very early, generally in the fall (August/September/October). Most of the bigger companies will finish their recruiting by Christmas/New Years.

## How

You should have an up to date resume ready. Other resources like a LinkedIn profile or GitHub account can also be helpful, but are not required for all applications.
