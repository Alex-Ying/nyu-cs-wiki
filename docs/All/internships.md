# Interships

## Why

Internships are a great way to get work experience. Not only do they make you a more competitive applicant when looking for a job after graduation, most companies will offer return offers to previous interns.

## When

One of the biggest mistakes students make is when to apply for internships. Applications open very early, generally in the fall (August/September/October) for summer internships. Most of the bigger companies will finish their recruiting by Christmas/New Years. You should start applying as soon as possible.

Many of the larger companies will have dedicated internships for freshman/sophomore such as [Google's STEP program](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/). These programs are a great way to get your foot in the door at a big company.

## How

You should have an up to date resume ready. Your resume should be succinct and at most one page. Other resources like a LinkedIn profile or GitHub account can also be helpful, but are not required for all applications.
